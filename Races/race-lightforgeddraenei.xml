		<description>
			<p>Draenei are members of the Alliance, having encountered the noble night elves shortly after their crash landing on Azeroth. Inspired by heroic tales of the Alliance and its victories, the draenei sought out and pledged their loyalty to the Alliance. due to their friendly and honorable attitude, they tend to get along well with races of both the Alliance and Horde, so long as personal grudges aren't included.</p>
			<h4>EXODAR DRAENEI</h4>
			<p>These draenei pledged their allegiance to the Alliance shortly after they crash landed on the Azuremust isles. Although their newfound home lies distant from the Eastern Kingdoms and much of the Alliance, they have become a valuable addition to its cause.</p>
			<h4>LIGHTFORGED DRAENEI</h4>
			<p>These draenei emerged from the twisting nether to aid in the far against the Burning Legion during the Third Invasion of Azeroth. These draenei were welcomed into the Alliance as they re-joined their exodar kin found on Azeroth.</p>
			<h4>BROKEN DRAENEI</h4>
			<p>These draenei are outcasts that have never pledged allegiance to any faction on Azeroth. They inhabit the broken planet of Draenor and are as likely to work together with members of the Alliance as they are members of the Horde.</p>
			<h4>DISTRUST OF THE ORCS</h4>
			<p>Although draenei are friendly and honorable towards other races, that attitude is quickly dissolved when confonrted by an orc. They remember the atrocities done to their race by the hands of orcs on Draenor and won't leave bygones of the past to be forgotten. Draenei carry a deep distrust and in some cases hate for the orcs.</p>
			<h4>DRAENEI NAMES</h4>
			<p>Draenei have two names, a birthname and an name taken upon reaching adulthood. There is no direct separate within draenei culture that separate birthnames from a name taken later in a draenei's life. Draenei have lost too much too much to still keep family names.</p>
