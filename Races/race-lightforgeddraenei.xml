		<description>
			<p class="flavor">Draenei are members of the Alliance, having encountered the noble night elves shortly after their crash landing on Azeroth. Inspired by heroic tales of the Alliance and its victories, the draenei sought out and pledged their loyalty to the Alliance. due to their friendly and honorable attitude, they tend to get along well with races of both the Alliance and Horde, so long as personal grudges aren't included.</p>
			<h4>EXODAR DRAENEI</h4>
			<p class="indent">These draenei pledged their allegiance to the Alliance shortly after they crash landed on the Azuremust isles. Although their newfound home lies distant from the Eastern Kingdoms and much of the Alliance, they have become a valuable addition to its cause.</p>
			<h4>LIGHTFORGED DRAENEI</h4>
			<p class="indent">These draenei emerged from the twisting nether to aid in the far against the Burning Legion during the Third Invasion of Azeroth. These draenei were welcomed into the Alliance as they re-joined their exodar kin found on Azeroth.</p>
			<h4>BROKEN DRAENEI</h4>
			<p class="indent">These draenei are outcasts that have never pledged allegiance to any faction on Azeroth. They inhabit the broken planet of Draenor and are as likely to work together with members of the Alliance as they are members of the Horde.</p>
			<h4>DISTRUST OF THE ORCS</h4>
			<p>Although draenei are friendly and honorable towards other races, that attitude is quickly dissolved when confonrted by an orc. They remember the atrocities done to their race by the hands of orcs on Draenor and won't leave bygones of the past to be forgotten. Draenei carry a deep distrust and in some cases hate for the orcs.</p>
			<h4>DRAENEI NAMES</h4>
			<p>Draenei have two names, a birthname and an name taken upon reaching adulthood. There is no direct separate within draenei culture that separate birthnames from a name taken later in a draenei's life. Draenei have lost too much too much to still keep family names.</p>
			<span class="feature">Male Names:</span>Meolphi, Bimerd, Hiktin, Ocdam, Nosmas, Ondut, Broruk, Oter, Lacasik, Midirgerd, Drocran<br />
			<span class="feature">Female Names:</span>Eshaatt, Ize, Ruka, Nalre, Hahse, Efae, Nerii, Asara, Velbus, Fuma, Oren, Suhe, Vumo<br />
			<h4>DRAENEI TRAITS</h4>
			<p>Your draenei character has a variety of natural abilities.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Charisma score increases by 2.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Draenei mature slightly slower than humans, reaching adulthood around age 20 and they can live thousands of year, exceeding the ancient ages of the night elves.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Alignment.</em></strong> Draenei are mostly good. Those who strive towards law are sages, priests, paladins, vindicators, or scholars. Those who tend toward chaos are warriors, rangers, or in other ways people more fond of pure fighting.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds. Your size is Medium.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> Accustomed to twilit forests and the night sky, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Keen Senses.</em></strong> You have proficiency in the Perception skill.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Fey Ancestry.</em></strong> You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed, and magic can’t put you to sleep.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Trance.</em></strong> Elves don’t need to sleep. Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is “trance.”) While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Subrace.</em></strong> Ancient divides among the elven people resulted in three main subraces: high elves, wood elves, and dark elves, who are commonly called drow. Choose one of these subraces. In some worlds, these subraces are divided still further (such as the sun elves and moon elves of the Forgotten Realms), so if you wish, you can choose a narrower subrace.</p>

		<description>
			<p>As a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. In many of the worlds of D&amp;D, there are two kinds of high elves. One type (which includes the gray elves and valley elves of Greyhawk, the Silvanesti of Dragonlance, and the sun elves of the Forgotten Realms) is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non-elves and even other elves. The other type (including the high elves of Greyhawk. the Qualinesti of Dragonlance, and the moon elves of the Forgotten Realms) are more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races. The sun elves of Faerûn (also called gold elves or sunrise elves) have bronze skin and hair of copper, black, or golden blond. Their eyes are golden, silver, or black. Moon elves (also called silver elves or gray elves) are much paler, with alabaster skin sometimes tinged with blue. They often have hair of silver-white, black, or blue, but various shades of blond, brown, and red are not uncommon. Their eyes are blue or green and flecked with gold.</p>

		<description>
			<p>As a wood elf, you have keen senses and intuition, and your fleet feet carry you quickly and stealthily through your native forests. This category includes the wild elves (grugach) of Greyhawk and the Kagonesti of Dragonlance, as well as the races called wood elves in Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms. In Faerûn, wood elves (also called wild elves, green elves, or forest elves) are reclusive and distrusting of non-elves. Wood elves’ skin tends to be copperish in hue, sometimes with traces of green. Their hair tends toward browns and blacks, but it is occasionally blond or copper-colored. Their eyes are green, brown, or hazel.</p>

			<p>Descended from an earlier subrace of dark-skinned elves, the drow were banished from the surface world for following the goddess Lolth down the path to evil and corruption. Now they have built their own civilization in the depths of the Underdark, patterned after the Way of Lolth. Also called dark elves, the drow have black skin that resembles polished obsidian and stark white or pale yellow hair. They commonly have very pale eyes (so pale as to be mistaken for white) in shades of lilac, silver, pink, red, and blue. They tend to be smaller and thinner than most elves.</p>
